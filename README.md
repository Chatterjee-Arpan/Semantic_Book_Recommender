# Semantic_Book_Recommender
Semantic Book Recommender is a Python-based tool that leverages LangChain and the OpenAI API to deliver highly personalized book recommendations via semantic search. By embedding both user preferences and a catalog of book metadata, it finds the closest matches in embedding spaceâ€”far beyond simple keyword matching.
